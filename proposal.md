# Software Introduction and Explaination

## Repository
<https://github.com/mch170001/Final-Project.git>

## Description
This program will be a helpful introduction for new artist and programmers to find what programs and software are used in specific fields like texturing, lighting, modeling, etc. 
User will be asked to put in their desired field of interest and the program will provide a list of what software is used as well as other information.

## Features
- Feature 1: Proper Field of Software
	- Program will specify the specific field of digital art and information.
- Feature 2: Information of Software
	- Program will also provide additional information of software, such as which operating system it can run on, what computer part is vital to the software(RAM,CPU,GPU), pricing.
- Feature N
	- When the program starts, it will ask for user input on what field they are interested in (ex: Modeling). 
  - Once the user gives the information, the program will give out the most used software (ex: ZBrush).
  - The program will also provide additonal software depending on if the user inputs another field of interest (ex: Texturing, Substance Painter). 

## Challenges
- Will need to refresh my knowledge with lists and dictoninaries as well as new ways to use them for this program.
- Must divide and solve individually the project to not feel overwhelmed, definitly making a schedule can help.
- Have to research specific programs used in the industry and organize them to be acessed by any users preference.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Ideally, I would have this be a functioning program one could open on almost any computer device

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The minimal outcome would be a .py file that provides a whole list of each field and software each use

## Milestones

- Week 1 (Nov 13 - 17)
  1. Goal 1: Research and organize fields and respected software in a spreadsheet or list 
  2. Goal 2: Devise a solution to catagorize the software with defining variables

- Week 2 (Nov 20 - 24)
  1. Goal 1: Start writing the base line of the program, testing if it functions
  2. Goal 2: Establish software and list of data in VS Code

- Week 3 (Nov 27 - Dec 1) (Final)
  1. Goal 1: Finalize the program
  2. Goal 2: Quality testing and Debug
